Why are you interested in taking CMSC320?

I believe that the world is moving towards a more data driven business platform. Companies, sports teams, schools, they are all trying to increase revenue and they can do so by utilizing and understanding data. I have always had a very good sense of detecting patterns and understanding trends so I hope that I will be able to pick up some topics in this class quick and be able to perfect them through out this course.
